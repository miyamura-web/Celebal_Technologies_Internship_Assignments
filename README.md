# Celebal_Technologies_Internship_Assignments

## WEEK 1 Assignment :-

### Summary :-
This SQL-based assignment was provided by the company during my internship and is centered around querying a transactional database, likely modeled on a retail or e-commerce environment. The primary objective is to extract, analyze, and interpret structured data across multiple dimensionsâ€”customers, orders, products, employees, and sales. The 42 queries are designed to test core SQL competencies such as data filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregation, joins, and subqueries. The assignment simulates real-world business reporting scenarios including identifying high-value customers, analyzing order patterns, tracking product performance, monitoring employee contributions, and calculating overall company revenue. It serves as a comprehensive exercise in business data analysis using SQL, aligning closely with data-driven decision-making tasks in enterprise environments.
